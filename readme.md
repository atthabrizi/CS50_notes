# Programming Learning Notes Repository

Hi there! Welcome to my personal Programming learning notes repository.

The materials in this notebook are versatile, but the underlying curriculum are based on Harvard's CS50 course, which is available online [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDDmrzzB14M&list=PLhQjrBD2T380F_inVRXMIHCqLaNUd7bN4). 

**Note:** The notes might not be organized by weeks and will be uploaded everytime I finished my study session, not necessarily in chronological order. I added the approximate progress percentage of each notebooks.

## Notes:
- Each folder is dedicated to a specific week or topic.
- Feel free to explore and find what you need.

## Collaboration:
Feel free to use these notes to help with your learning journey.
If you find mistakes, let me know at [atthabrizi@gmail.com](mailto:atthabrizi@gmail.com)!

While this is mostly for me, if you have cool notes or ideas, let's team up!
Happy learning!

Abbe Atthabrizi
